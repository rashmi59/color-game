In our replication project, we are reproducing the work of Watson & Humphreys in investigating how our brain uses visual marking to prioritize the search of new events (Watson & Hymphreys,1997). The paper investigates a different set of experiments that show how visual selection is prioritized by introducing new objects. The paper’s main research question is whether searching for a target over two different sets of distractors would be as efficient as searching over just the latter set, presuming that one of those is presented prior to the other. The authors argue that by performing top-down attentional inhibition, the old static items would be ignored in the search process and only the newly presented set would be searched by the subjects.
To measure the extent of which visual marking occurs the authors conduct several experiments, we are replicating the experiment in section ​3b as outlined in the paper. The baseline/control experiment, the subjects are presented with a set of 8 letters (blue A’s), which act as distractors. The subjects are exposed to these letters for a certain period of time that then disappear and are replaced with another set of 8 letter distractors (green H’s). The latter set can also contain a target, which in that case was a blue letter ​H. The subjects are asked to identify whether a target was present and the mean response time for a correct answer is recorded. The main experimental treatment applied was making the first set of distractors(blue A’s) remain on-screen as the other set (green H’s) appear. In both these conditions, the time to which the subjects are exposed to the first set is varied. This time interval is known as the Interstimulus Interval (ISI). The ISI in these experiments is the independent variable, whereas the mean response time to a correct answer (of whether a target was present or not) is the dependent variable. Throughout both the baseline and treatment experiments the ISI was randomly selected to be either 100ms, 400ms, or 800ms.
The goal of the experiment was to determine, if in-fact, given a sufficient ISI time, that subjects would search the two sets of distractors for a target as efficiently (similar response time to a correct answer) as if only the second items were present (baseline condition) by performing top-down attentional inhibition where as the old distractors presented first would be ignored in the search process and only the newly presented set would be searched by the subjects.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
